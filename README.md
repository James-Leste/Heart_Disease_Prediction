# Machine Learning Project: Heart Disease Prediction
Early detection and prediction of heart diseases are vital for timely intervention and prevention. In this study, we compare the performance of five machine learning algorithms, namely, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest in predicting the presence or absence of heart disease.
